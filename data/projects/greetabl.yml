  blurb: "This casual gifting company needed help pinpointing UI/UX improvements for their mobile users."
  intro:
    - "Greetabl is a startup based in Saint Louis, whose mission is to make the art of casual gifting easier and more fun."
  problem:
    - "With almost half of their website traffic coming from mobile users, Greetabl was seeing a higher bounce rate and an influx of customer service issues coming from that segment."
  solution:
    - "I pinpointed the most relevant UI/UX and content issues that were potentially damaging Greetabl's mobile experience, which helped the design and content strategy teams focus on relevant areas of improvement."
  workflow:
    - block:
      copy: "My research work started by interviewing Greetabl's customer service representatives and digging into existing qualitative data, such as analytics and NPS reports. I was able to get a more detailed picture of what issues their mobile users were facing in order to focus on the most problematic interactions during usability testing."

    - block:
      copy: "After recruiting a group of six testers whose profiles matched Greetabl's target demographics, I assigned these participants a list of tasks that covered the issues identified earlier. My goal was to better understand when, why and how they happened based on direct feedback."

    - block:
      copy: "The insights from these usability sessions were then used to define a list of opportunities for UI/UX improvement. I also made sure these were aligned with a list of references and best practices from a heuristics exercise I had conducted alongside Greetabl stakeholders during the project kickoff. Among the aspects highlighted were ease of use, minimalistic UI, and level of product customization."

    - block:
      copy: "Using my skillset in front-end development, I came up with a series of mockups based on coded tweaks made to Greetabl's existing mobile experience. These were key in order to illustrate the recommended UI/UX changes and guide the redesign process."

  learnings:
    - "The most interesting thing about this project was being able to apply my coding skills as a way to quickly convey how to improve a mobile shopping experience. This created a multidisciplinary bridge across all project teams, allowing me to use a common language in order to strategize, mediate and guide work between UI designers and UI engineers."
