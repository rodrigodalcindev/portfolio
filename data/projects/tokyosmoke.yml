  blurb: "I helped this recreational cannabis start-up uncover and understand a very diverse target audience."
  intro:
    - "Tokyo Smoke is a Toronto-based company aiming to bring a lifestyle and design-oriented take to the recreational cannabis space in light of the regulation framework being implemented by the Canadian government."
  problem:
    - "Tokyo Smoke's brand positioning was not entirely clear to their target audience. Lack of specialized online content was also an issue they wanted to addresss, but weren't quite sure about where to focus on."
  solution:
    - "I conducted a series of interviews that resulted in a concise and informative snapshot of Tokyo Smoke's target audience archetypes. This helped the client understand how to shape their online content experience, fulfilling their customer's information and knowledge needs while favouring user conversion."

      copy: "Using qualitative research as an exploratory method, I recruited and interviewed ten participants, including both novices and active cannabis consumers. My goal was to learn more about the feelings and expectations based on individual opinions, stories and experiences. The group of people I interviewed embodied a diverse target audience, which resulted in a set of four different personas."

      copy: "Among the recurring themes, the need for information and education about cannabis consumables was definitely predominant. In light of legalization by the Canadian government, people expect detailed information in regards to sourcing and production, strain variety and components, range of psychoactive effects, potency and methods of consumption."

      copy: "Normalization of shopping experiences also presented considerable relevance. I found out that people draw strongly from what they're already familiar with such as shopping for wine, coffee or tea. This insight revealed that the recreational cannabis market should focus on approachability, consistency and product curation."

      copy: "Finally, the topic of legalization brought up lots of mixed feelings, information gaps and unknowns. People's perception of the future of cannabis in Canada oscillated heavily between skepticism and optimism, which provided an opportunity for educational content."
