  blurb: "I helped this recreational cannabis start-up uncover and understand a very diverse target audience."
  intro:
    - "Tokyo Smoke is a Toronto-based company aiming to bring a lifestyle and design-oriented take to the recreational cannabis space, in light of the regulatory framework being implemented by the Canadian government."
  problem:
    - "Tokyo Smoke's brand positioning was not entirely clear to their target audience. A lack of specialized online content was also an issue the client wanted to address but wasn't quite sure about what to prioritize and focus on."
  solution:
    - "I conducted a series of interviews that resulted in a detailed and informative set of personas and user journeys. This helped the client understand how to shape their online content experience, fulfilling the audience's need for knowledge and information while favoring user conversion."

      copy: "Using qualitative research as an exploratory method, I recruited and interviewed ten participants ranging from novices to active cannabis consumers. My goal was to learn more about their feelings and expectations based on opinions, stories, and experiences. The group of people I interviewed embodied a very diverse target audience, which resulted in a set of four different personas."

      copy: "Among the recurring themes, a need for information and knowledge about cannabis consumables was clearly predominant. In light of the legalization process by the Canadian government, people expected to find detailed and educational content touching on themes such as sourcing and production, strain variety and components, psychoactive effects, dosage, potency and alternative methods of consumption."

      copy: "The normalization of shopping experiences also displayed considerable relevance. I found out that people tend to refer to what they're already familiar with such as buying wine, coffee or organic food. This insight revealed that the recreational cannabis market should focus on approachability, consistency and product curation."

      copy: "Finally, the topic of legalization brought up lots of mixed feelings, information gaps, and unknowns. People's perception of the future of cannabis in Canada oscillated heavily between skepticism and optimism, which provided an opportunity for content around government policies."
